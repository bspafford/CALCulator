# CALCulator
This was a project I built for my calculus final. We were assigned to make something that’s main focus was calculus, whether it be a skit, a music video, or something else. My teacher showed some examples of the things we could do. One of them really stood out to me. It was a simple window with a text input for equations and another window that displayed a 3d graph. The teacher was amazed by this, thinking it was the coolest thing he’s ever seen, but I knew it was a simple python library that took 20 minutes to code. So I thought why not make a project that has a lot of useful features and also contain their final project in mine. So that’s exactly why I did. I spent the rest of the school year designing this calculator that hopefully will be useful enough to replace the TI-84 that everyone was using.
